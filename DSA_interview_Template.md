Before Coding
Restated the problem in own words
Asked about input constraints/edge cases: lower/upper case
No chars
Discussed at least 2 approaches:
stack
Stated time/space complexity of chosen approach
Got "go-ahead" before coding

During Coding
Talked through what they're writing
Used meaningful variable names
Wrote modular/clean code
Handled edge cases (empty input, single element, etc.)

After Coding
Walked through code with an example
Tested edge cases manually
Identified and fixed bugs
Discussed potential optimizations
